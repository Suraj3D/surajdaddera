<h1 style="color: #cc0000">Data & Abstractions</h1>

<p>If you’re looking to add a new furry friend to your family, you may be encouraged to “adopt not shop”. That is, to find a new dog at a local shelter or rescue organization rather than a pet store or breeder.

  But where do adoptable dogs in 
  New York
   come from?

<section></section>
  <h2 style="color: #ff0000">This question can be complicated, so let’s start with one dog.</h2> </p>

<h1 style="color: #cc0000">Visuals & Representations</h1>
<img src="/img/02.jpg" alt="not valid" width="868" height="636">
<p>Each dog above is depicted by an icon that is most visually similar to the presumed primary breed of the dog. Each import into the state was determined by parsing the PetFinder description for each animal.</p>


<h1 style="color: #cc0000">Aesthetics & Design</h1>
<img src="/img/03.jpg" alt="not valid" width="868" height="636">
<p>All dogs displayed as exported from a particular state are also depicted as imported to another state. In this graphic, there are more imports displayed than exports since some imported dogs came from outside the US. Further, US Territories are not displayed here, since we only collected import data for the 50 US states and Washington DC. Each import into the state was determined by parsing the PetFinder description for each animal available for adoption within that state.</p>
<p><h2>Space = Web</h2></p>
<p><h2>Structure = Rectangle</h2></p>
<p><h2>Mark = Dot, line</h2></p>
<p><h2>Position = x: Name of the artists, y: Adjusted pageviews in Wikipedia</h2></p>
<p><h2>Color = Black<</h2></p>
<p><h2>Circle annotation</h2></p>


</p>
<h1 style="color: #cc0000">Framing & Transition</h1>
<p>Transition is done in the style of scrollytelling.
    Layers of static graphic were overlaid to achieve the framing.
</p>
 
<h1 style="color: #cc0000">Messaging & Annotation</h1>
<img src="../image/image9.png" alt="not valid" width="800" height="600">
<p>Annotation is done in circles showing the entire details of the artist, photo and cause of death.
    Even the insights are annotated in circles giving a violet color.

</p>
<h1 style="color: #cc0000">Flow & Coherence</h1>
<p>Scrollytelling begins with a static frame representing the viewers of Beyonce when she released Lemeonade.
    Then compared that graph along with the viewers of Prince.
    Comparing Beyonce, Prince viewers were very less.
    After his death the pageview increased rapidly.
    Also represented the list of  celebrity died during different time.
    Even their page got much more importance than big events in the country.
    Next session is a comparison between the list of artist's pageviews before and after death.
</p>
<h1 style="color: #cc0000">Interaction & Engagement</h1>
<img src="/img/Doggif.gif" width="800" height="600">
<p>Interactive layers stacked together for the story. Insights are marked in circles, which get highlighted.
    When hovering through the circles(representing artists) we get information about each artist and the reason for their death.
    Entire story is said in  minimal text, which we can scroll, along with it we can see the graphical representation in the background.
</p>
